# Image Segmentation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

This project demonstrates image segmentation using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python. The project utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the image segmentation script, follow these steps:

1. Place the input image(s) in the `input` directory.

2. Run the `image_segmentation.py` script:

   ```
   python image_segmentation.py
   ```

3. The segmented images will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Algorithm

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric classification algorithm. In image segmentation, KNN is used to classify each pixel into different classes based on the similarity of its neighboring pixels.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Load the input image.

2. Convert the image to the desired color space (e.g., RGB, grayscale).

3. Preprocess the image if necessary (e.g., noise removal, smoothing).

4. For each pixel in the image, extract its neighboring pixels.

5. Calculate the similarity between the pixel and its neighbors using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).

6. Classify the pixel based on the majority class of its neighbors (using a voting mechanism).

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all pixels in the image.

8. Save the segmented image.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the image segmentation script:

```python
import cv2

# Load the input image
image = cv2.imread('input/image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply image segmentation using KNN algorithm
segmented_image = knn_segmentation(gray)

# Save the segmented image
cv2.imwrite('output/segmented_image.jpg', segmented_image)
```
